      <description>Well that didn’t go as planned. I said these exact words. “I feel that I know a lot about college basketball.” I had an opportunity with the big-10 tournament winning that and thought I could do the same thing. Little did I know that I would finish in 11th place out of 17 people. With my professor beating me in the final days.So How did I do?</description>

With this model, I see that I have chosen very wrong, but let’s see what where It will go.</description>
