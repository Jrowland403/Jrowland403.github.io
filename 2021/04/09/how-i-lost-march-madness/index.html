<p>Well that didn’t go as planned. I said these exact words. “I feel that I know a lot about college basketball.” I had an opportunity with the big-10 tournament winning that and thought I could do the same thing. Little did I know that I would finish in 11th place out of 17 people. With my professor beating me in the final days.
So How did I do?</p>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The first round came and went. Started like most people did by losing Ohio State right away. My model predicted Ohio State would win with 85% confidence. That looked bad. But I did finish around the top four for the first round. Then as the games began, I watched as my champion Illinois plummeted to their demise. My midwest was perfect except for the San Diego State. Though when Buddy Boeheim shooting the lights out that will happen. My model showed San Diego State winning with a 51% toss up game. So where did I go wrong from those picks. I should also mention that I got the Abilene Christian Game horribly wrong which knocked out my championship team from the left side out. My model had the Longhorns with a 71% chance to win. Abilene Christian took that right away.</p>
</div>
<div id="choices-for-success" class="section level2">
<h2>Choices for Success</h2>
<p>So as it seems a few metrics to consider are really the pace of a team. That is how Oral Roberts came out and dominated Ohio State. The main metrics I chose were similar to how I won the BIG-10 bracket round. I took a team’s offensive rating and defensive rating. That was it. In an ideal world this bracket needs a few more metrics to choose from. Those are turnovers and true shooting. That is why I ended up finishing where I did. I feel that most of my picks were spot on. But as to why I lost was simply by missing some key metrics. For example I did not realize free throw percentage would be so important between the UCLA and Michigan. It just shows why Isaiah Livers was missing. But as to how other students did on there brackets as well as my own against my model.</p>
</div>
<div id="rivals-and-failures" class="section level2">
<h2>Rivals and Failures</h2>
<p>The choices made were horrible that I made. My Professor Matt said “Trust the Model.” So what did I do? I did not trust my model and look where that got me. I thought Illinois would be a real team. But since Gonzaga and Baylor were number one and two at the beginning of 2019 and this season at 2020, it was almost a shoe in that they would make it there. Other brackets of mine did better but I put way to much thought into this bracket challenge. With the 25 brackets I made, 2 correctly picked that Baylor would win. In an ESPN Tournament Challenge Bracket finish at position 5,934 out of 14.7 million. So maybe that bracket truly was the correct option. But I’ll swallow my pride. To those ahead of me and the winners, I respectfully fold and get ready to enter next year.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So that is how I end March Madness 2020-2021. But I get to enjoy a fantastic dinner and spend time with my grandparents. I expect this next year to be closer.</p>
